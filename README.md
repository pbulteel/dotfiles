# dotfiles

It's important that you can setup your environment quickly and get back into a working mindset as quickly as possible. I have started streamlining my dotfiles, moving things into functions, setting up my prompt and improving how I deploy this.

To copy your existing config files use the `backup` option.

``` bash
./dotfiles.sh backup
```

To restore those files and get your configuration files in the proper location, use the `restore` option.

``` bash
./dotfiles.sh restore
```
